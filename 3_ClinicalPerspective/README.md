## Abstract
Studies have shown brain-computer interfaces (BCIs) can allow people with severe motor impairment to communicate using brain signals rather than muscles independently in their homes. However, after over three decades of research, BCIs remain unavailable to the people who need them most. The Shirley Ryan Ability Lab in Chicago, Illinois and the National Center for Adaptive Neurotechnologies (NCAN) in Albany, New York are exploring the use of telehealth to introduce clinicians, their patients, and patient caregivers to EEG-based BCI technology in the form of a simple one-target SSVEP-based BCI called the MusicBox. We are developing methods for BCI training, use, and support. This talk will address the background and significance, current work, and the challenges, of these methods.
