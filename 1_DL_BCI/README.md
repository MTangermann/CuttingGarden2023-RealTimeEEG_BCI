## Abstract
Current brain-computer interfaces (BCIs) do not generalize well across domains (e.g., sessions and subjects) without expensive supervised re-calibration on small domain-specific data, which severely limits BCI utility and scalability. Fortunately, geometric deep learning offers a remedy via combining data-efficiency and invariances of Riemannian geometry aware methods with feature learning capabilities of neural nets. In this talk, I will present a geometric deep learning framework to perform unsupervised domain adaptation (UDA) on the symmetric, positive definite (SPD) manifold. The framework can be readily applied to multi-source/-target and online UDA scenarios. Using oscillatory EEG BCI datasets, we demonstrate that a simple, network architecture, which we denote TSMNet, can obtain state-of-the-art performance in inter-session and -subject transfer without compromising on neurophysiological interpretability.
